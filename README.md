# Hospital_record_management_system
The Hospital Record Management System focuses on developing a comprehensive hospital record management system that utilizes primary indexing for efficient organization and retrieval of patient records. The system will incorporate functionalities such as adding, deleting, updating, and searching records, with specific emphasis on gender-based search and description-based search. The project will implement primary indexing as the primary method for organizing and indexing patient records. Each record will be assigned a unique primary key, such as a medical record number or social security number, enabling direct access and retrieval of specific records. The system will ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and compliance with privacy regulations. The system will provide a user-friendly interface to add new patient records, allowing healthcare professionals to input essential details. Additionally, the system will support the deletion and updating of records to reflect any changes or updates to the patient's information. The project will incorporate advanced search functionalities to enable quick and accurate retrieval of patient records. Healthcare professionals will be able to search for records based on various parameters, including patient name, admission date, gender, and description-based search terms. This functionality will be useful in cases where gender-specific medical data analysis or research is required and enabling users to search for specific records based on textual descriptions or keywords related to the patient's medical condition, symptoms, or treatments respectively. These features will assist in locating records with specific characteristics or medical details.
